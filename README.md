# API-weather-app
<br/>
<h3>Introduction:</h3>
<br/>
This project is a simple, interactive Weather App that allows users to input the name of a city or country and receive real-time weather information using the OpenWeatherMap API. 
<br/>
It is built with core web technologies — HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for functionality.
<br/>

The app fetches data like temperature, humidity, and weather conditions and displays it in a clean, user-friendly interface. 
<br/>
It demonstrates practical knowledge of API integration, asynchronous JavaScript (fetch), and DOM manipulation.
